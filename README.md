# Unofficial YuGiOh! Deckbuilder
Unofficial YuGiOh! deckbuilder tool made in Pygame.

## Usage
You can start the application by starting main.py.  
As soon as you start the program you will be presented with the option to start a completly new deck or to import one from a ydk file.   
NOTE: Importing may take some time if the cards images aren't already cached.

In the center of your screen you will find the three portions that make up a YuGiOh! deck stacked vertically on top of each other.

Card inspector and searcher are still under development.

pip3 install requests pygame
